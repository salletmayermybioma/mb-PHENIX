### What is mb-PHENIX

The supervised based imputation of mb-PHENIX is based on the assumption that data present on high amounts of missing data, that do not let the user find a well-clustered structure on the microbiota data. Another assumption is that microbiota data is high-dimensional and using traditional reductional such as PCA or any Multidimensional scaling variants does not permit finding well patterns. 

Therefore,  mb-PHENIX  is ideal for datasets where similar samples have the same experimental sampling process and sequencing methodology. However, due to technological noise, does not allow finding patterns and much information about the differential expression of taxa.


### How to use
You need first to uses UMAP (non-linear dimensional reducion) in a supervised manner  more information in here [click here](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supervised.html)


The main implementation of this code is available in `umap.parametric_umap` in the [UMAP repository](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) (v0.5+). Most people reading this will want to use that code, and can ignore this repository. 

The code in this repository is the 'messy' version. It has custom training loops which are a bit more verbose and customizable. It might be more useful for integrating UMAP into your custom models. 

The code can be installed with `python setup.py develop`. Though, unless you're just trying to reproduce our results, you'll probably just want to pick through the notebooks and tfumap folder for the code relevant to your project. 

In addition, we have a more verbose Colab notebook to walk you through the algorithm:

### What's inside

This repo contains the code needed to produce all of the results in the paper. The network architectures we implement (in Tensorflow) are non-parametric UMAP, Parametric UMAP, a UMAP/AE hybrid, and a UMAP/classifier network hybrid.

The UMAP/classifier hybrid can be used for semisupervised learning on structured data. An example with the moons dataset is shown below, where in the left panel, the colored points are labeled training data, the grey points are unlabled data, and the background is the network's decision boundary.
